# Neuronal_networks
Neural Network Implementation and Evaluation for decision over automatic investment (used of a self developed neural network)

## Description: Developed and evaluated a neural network for classification tasks using Python and various machine learning techniques.
## Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loaded .npy files, handled missing values, reshaped data and applied one-hot encoding.
## Neural Network Development:Implemented a neural network with various activation (ReLU, ELU, Leaky ReLU) and cost (cross-entropy) functions. Designed feedforward and backpropagation methods.
## Model Training and Optimization: Trained the neural network using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with mini-batch processing and L2 regularization.Conducted hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal learning rate and regularization parameter. Monitored training progress by tracking training and validation accuracy and cost at each epoch.
## Evaluation and Validation: Implemented early stopping to prevent overfitting and optimize the training duration. Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy and cost function on validation data. Saved trained models and their architectures using Python's pickle module for future use and reproducibility.

Libraries: NumPy, TensorFlow Keras, Pickle
Techniques: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, one-hot encoding, stochastic gradient descent, L2 regularization, early stopping
## Achievements: Improved accuracy and performance through optimized activation functions, regularization techniques, and hyperparameter tuning.
